# 🎧 Loop Earbuds – Concept Website by Rin Morito

Welcome to my **concept project** inspired by the real brand **Loop Earplugs**.  
This is an **imaginary product campaign website** that introduces a fictional earbud model I designed in *Cinema 4D*.  
The goal is to explore how design, motion, and 3D technology can elevate a digital product experience.

## 👩🏻‍💻 About

This project was created as part of my **Interactive Media Design** coursework at Fanshawe College.  
It represents my skills in **web design, front-end development, and 3D interaction**, combining creativity and technical execution.

The site aims to replicate the feel of a real product campaign—immersive, dynamic, and visually engaging.

## 💡 Concept

While **Loop Earplugs** focuses on hearing protection and sound balance,  
this project reimagines what it might look like if **Loop** expanded into **wireless earbuds**.

The concept emphasizes:
- Sleek and ergonomic design  
- Immersive 3D presentation  
- Calm, modern aesthetics inspired by Loop’s visual identity
